    "### The equation\n",
    "In two dimensions, the wave equation will read\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = \\nu^2 \\nabla^2 u$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we've introduced the Laplacian operator, $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The finite difference approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is the Laplacian operator. It is like the $\\mathbf{A}$ matrix we used heavily in prior units, but it now contains two derivatives. Let's think about how this works using similar notation to before. A second dimension, $y$, introduces a new index. Now $u_{i,j}^k = u(x_0+i\\Delta x, y_0+j\\Delta y, t_0 +k\\Delta t)$. Note $x\\to i$, $y \\to j$, and $t \\to k$. The Laplacian applied to $u_{i,j}^k$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\nabla^2 u \\approx \\frac{1}{\\Delta x^2} \\left(u_{i-1,j}^k - 2 u_{i,j}^k + u_{i+1,j}^k + u_{i,j-1}^k - 2 u_{i,j}^k + u_{i,j+1}^k\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x^2} \\left(u_{i,j-1}^k + u_{i-1,j}^k - 4 u_{i,j}^k  + u_{i+1,j}^k + u_{i,j+1}^k\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which, if the column vector $\\mathbf{u}$ is written down the rows of a matrix representing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "While it will prove challenging, you've already learned what you need to know about implementing this in Python. For this homework, you will solve the 2D wave equation both implicitly and explicitly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints, tips, and requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Some words about boundary conditions\n",
    "In one dimension, we had left and right points as boundary conditions. Now, we've got a more complicated situation with $N$ points on each of 4 boundaries - top, bottom, left, and right. I recommend that you create descriptive labels for each of the boundaries and then apply them in something like the way I left for you to look at in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Move to sparse matrices\n",
    "I've been sloppy about pushing you to use sparse matrices, but in this assignment I'm going to insist that you make the transition. It isn't difficult. Consult [scipy.spase][https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html]. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Matrix operators\n",
    "For the explicit model, you'll need to find the second derivative of every value of a previous solution. To do this, you need to use an operation like A * u, where A is the second derivative operator matrix, and u is some solution. I think you know how to form the operator matrix. You'll need to do the multiplication. This can be done with A.dot(u). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Visual package\n",
    "This assignment is going to be a lot more enjoyable if you can look at the output. To do this move to the visual package to represent your output. There is code below. It won't work in Jupyter, but is there for your reference so you can use it from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Problem setup\n",
    "I've left some code below to help you understand initial conditions and boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Specific questions\n",
    "With your code I want you to address explicit vs. implicit solutions. Determine which is best for\n",
    "* stability, how big a beta can you use?\n",
    "* performance, which is faster - be quantitative.\n",
    "* accuracy, do either of the solutions introduce behaviors that aren't in the physics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Address these questions with some written text that is submitted along with your code.\n",
