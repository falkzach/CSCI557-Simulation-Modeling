    "**HINT:** *It is simple to go through each of the terms in the quadratic equation, consider the magnitude with suggested inputs, and identify where two numbers of very similar magnitude are being subtracted. That will be the source of error. Your strategy will be to reduce the error by avoiding the problematic subtraction.*\n"
