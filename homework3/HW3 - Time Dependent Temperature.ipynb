    "## Time dependent partial differential equations\n",
    "In this notebook, we begin solving time dependent equations. It's a small step up from the previous notebook in the sense that the differential operator for the second derivative is still there. However, there is a pretty big step in terms of how time is accounted for in the functions. We will opt for an *implicit* scheme. Effectively answering the question of *what happens next?* with *what happens next depends on...what happens next*. Alarming at first, but ultimately a good thing!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heat transfer\n",
    "To test our newly gained understanding of representing differential operators as matrices and solving PDEs with the finite difference method, let us try a new equation - the time dependent diffusion equation. This is often thought of as a heat transfer problem, but the same form of equation represents ground water flow, chemical diffusion, elastic displacement, and electric fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The equation\n",
    "The heat transfer equation is expressed in terms of the temperature, $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = S(x,t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho$ is the material density, $c_p$ is the heat capacity, $k$ the thermal conductivity, and $S(x,t)$ a source of heat. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the first time, we are looking at a true partial differential equation. Temperature is a function of both space, $x$, and time, $t$. We'll write that two ways, as $T(x,t)$, and later when working with a grid as $T_x^t$. Hence, the $\\partial$ is a special symbol telling the reader that this derivative is found by holding all variables except the one used to differentiate constant. A common mistake is to use $\\textrm{d}$ for derivatives when you mean $\\partial$, or vice-versa. Be careful!\n",
    "\n",
    "The origin of this equation can be understood by considering a 'control volume' or in this case a 'control line' -an infinitesimal portion of the domain, represented by $\\textrm{d}x$. Heat flows in as $Q(x)$, heat flows out a $Q(x+dx)$. The difference results in the time rate of change in temperature. A source can be added for completeness. We worked through this on the board, in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finite difference approximation\n",
    "The equation is 'descretized' by representing the derivatives as finite difference approximations. The first derivative on time is written\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{T(x,t+\\Delta t) - T(x,t)}{\\Delta t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and, the second derivative found by twice taking the centered difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial^2T}{\\partial x^2} \\approx \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{T(x+\\Delta x,t) - T(x-\\Delta x,t)}{2\\Delta x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial T(x+\\Delta x,t) }{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial T(x-\\Delta x,t) }{\\partial x}\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$=\\frac{1}{2\\Delta x}\\left(\\frac{T(x,t)-T(x+2\\Delta x,t) - T(x-2\\Delta x,t) + T(x,t)}{2\\Delta x}\\right) = \\frac{T(x-\\Delta x,t) -2T(x,t) + T(x+\\Delta x,t)}{\\Delta x^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the derivatives approximated with finite differences, the PDE equation can be written\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{T(x,t+\\Delta t) - T(x,t)}{\\Delta t} - \\kappa \\frac{T(x-\\Delta x,t) -2T(x,t) + T(x+\\Delta x,t)}{\\Delta x^2} = \\frac{S(x,t)}{\\rho c_p}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where I have introduced $\\kappa = \\frac{k}{\\rho c_p}$, the thermal diffusivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### System of linear equations####\n",
    "All those parentheses make it cumbersome. Let's clean up the notation by observing the we are doing physics on a grid. One grid is for space, and the $i^{\\textrm{th}}$ point on that grid will be given by $i \\Delta x$. The other grid is in time and the $j^{\\textrm{th}}$ point on that grid will be given by $j \\Delta t$. Bot $i$ and $j$ begin at zero. If we write $T(x,t) = T_i^j$, the equation becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{T_i^{j+1} - T_i^j}{\\Delta t} - \\kappa \\frac{T_{i-1}^j - 2T_i^j + T_{i+1}^j}{\\Delta x^2} = \\frac{S_i^j}{\\rho c_p}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for something different. The obvious way to do this was to write all the times on $T$ in the second derivative operator as $T^j$, or at time $t$. This is called an *explicit* method. But, it turns out that we can write them as $T^{j+1}$, or time $t+\\Delta t$ and move things around to create a valid linear system to solve. This is called *implicit* time stepping. It is beyond the scope of these notes, but implicit methods are more stable than explicit ones. This means that we'll be justified in taking a much larger $\\Delta t$ when we solve the system numerically. Good! The new system is\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{T_i^{j+1} - T_i^j}{\\Delta t} - \\kappa \\frac{T_{i-1}^{j+1} - 2T_i^{j+1} + T_{i+1}^{j+1}}{\\Delta x^2} = \\frac{S_i^j}{\\rho c_p}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression can be rearranged algebraically to give.\n",
    "\n",
    "$T_i^{j+1} - \\frac{\\kappa \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}\\left( T_{i-1}^{j+1} - 2T_i^{j+1} + T_{i+1}^{j+1}\\right) = \\Delta t \\frac{S_i^j}{\\rho c_p} + T_i^j$\n",
